Kernels in operating systems are defined as the core of an Operating System, containing the things needed to connect
the user applications to the hardware.

LKernels & PyKernels work similarly, but instead of connection with the hardware, they connect to the Operating System.
This allows a "Sub System". Which is the model LKernels and PyKernels are based on.
